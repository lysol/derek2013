I missed out on the whole zine thing, being born in the early 80s and all. By
the mid-90s, during what would be considered my coming-of-age temporal range,
DIY was dead, shamed by the slick beige stylings of PC towers and desktop
publishing. Though, there's a certain charm to those dot matrix banners. I was
going to put a picture of one here, but I couldn't find one within 20 seconds of
thumbing through Google Image Search.

Last Month [Rua](http://ruaarnold.com) and I attended a local 
[zine revival event](https://www.facebook.com/events/546974538669879/) and a good
number of random people I wasn't sure knew or didn't know eachother made things out
of paper.

Here is the zine I made there, which I called "Pyramid" or "Pyramids". I can't
remember which, it also doesn't matter. Thanks for listening to my radio show.

Also check out out Rua's zine ["Such Good Boys"](http://ruaarnold.tumblr.com/post/48559582564/my-first-ready-for-primetime-zine-is-available-for), which is much different than mine.
