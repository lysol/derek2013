Weird music! I like weird things, some of it tries too hard, some of it feels
magical, some of it is so weird it just feels right. Even traditional artists
have some weird moments, and even weird bands have really weird moments.

I really like noise. I don't always want to listen to it, but I like knowing
it's there, available for a caffeine rush at work to blast out the entire
range of human hearing with some form of screeches, cars trying to drive on
railroad tracks, donkeys trying to perform long division, so on and so forth.

A lot of the material I consider noisey isn't really true noise, like that
crap that bands like Whitehouse churned out in the 80s and on. Here's a list
of stuff I think is quite listenable, if you get in the right mood or have the
right setting.

[Atari Teenage Riot &mdash; Live at Brixton Academy 1999](http://atariteenageriot.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-brixton-academy-1999-remastered)
---------------------------------------------------------

Lots of digital noises here. This show is legendary, and serves as the bookend
to ATR's otherwise sophomoric career. I thought ATR was pretty cool when I
heard some of the cool kids listening to it back in highschool, but I
definitely recognize it as mostly crap with a few gems. This is a gem.

There's a good number of samples and semi-rhythms here, and it doesn't
overstay its welcome, coming in at 26:38.

[Nurse With Wound / Whitehouse &mdash; The 150 Murderous Passions](http://www.discogs.com/150-Murderous-Passions-Or-Those-Belonging-To-The-Fourth-Class-Composing-The-28-Days-Of-February-Spen/release/97390)
------------------------------------------------------------------

I haven't listened to this one in a while, so my memory of it might be
incorrect. I can also only remember the first track, the second track wasn't
as interesting.

The first one takes a little bit to get going, but the thing that sticks out
in my memory is there's this distorted bell noise with some long echoes. Lots
of screaming, random piano. I guess this is the only instance of the guy from
Nurse With Wound recording vocals. Whitehouse's contribution seems to be the production
style, while the form and structure in a certain way are pretty obviously Nurse
With Wound's doing, if you've listened to any of their other work.  If it wasn't
some spread-spectrum chaos, it would indeed be a very minimalist track.

I had these neighbors once who were basically garbage people, so one morning
after they finally went to bed around 5AM I played this as loud as I could.
The lack of bass or even a lot of midrange probably didn't carry it through
the 100 year old thick plaster walls, but I hope at least someone wondered why
a suicidal train was crying in my apartment.

[Zs &mdash; New Slaves](http://www.discogs.com/Zs-New-Slaves/release/2283731)
-----------------------

There's probably some heavy-handed reason for the name of this track. It's the
only noisy thing on my list that has a saxophone in it.

Another "short" track at 20 minutes, this one is very rhythmic and isn't what
a lot of people might consider noise. It's definitely some kind of jazz, but
the instrumentation sounds so stressful on the instruments involved and I'm
fairly certain there aren't any true notes here. Fans of the horn catastrophe
in the second half of Radiohead's "The National Anthem" will like this one.

A couple of jobs ago, I'd have to write a lot of heavily nested database
queries, so to properly get in the mood to work I'd drink a little bit of the
[The Black Blood of the Earth](http://www.funraniumlabs.com/the-black-blood-of-the-earth/)
and shoot this track into my eardrums on repeat. The trick is,
after the third or fourth listen, you forget it's even there, and when you
turn it off, the loudest workplace environment ends up sounding more like a
quiet bathroom in the service hallways of a mall.

[Melvins &mdash; The Colossus of Destiny](http://www.discogs.com/Melvins-Colossus-Of-Destiny/release/951621)
-----------------------------------------

I was going to write about how much of a fondness I have for this album, but
I wasn't really feeling it. It's fairly low-volume synth noise with oft-
looped samples. You can tell nearly all of it is just knob-twiddling on
synths. It's quieter than you'd expect based on the name. I read a book
because of this album, *The Road to Los Angeles*. The main character writes a
book, his magnum opus *The Colossus of Destiny*, while also coming of age
in 1930s L. A. Think *Catcher in the Rye*, except it's good.

[Anything by Black Dice](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Black+Dice)
------------------------

I don't know, it's all pretty similar, and pretty great. There's a lot of rhythm
here, and if you get past your own ideals of music you can find a groove, tap your
foot, pound a shot or whatever it is you do. I've been really feeling "Repo" and
"Mr. Impossible", and they all boast some pretty great song titles. For instance,
"The Jacker". Just think about that title, say it out loud, then go listen to the
track. *The Jacker.* Now you get it.

The type of noise I really get into usually has some rhythm or repetition, maybe
some melodic aspects, definitely multiple layers, and/or some kind of distortion.
I usually turn it on when I'm just absurdly bored with everything else around and I
need a healthy shot of weird to break up the monotony. Your mileage may vary!
