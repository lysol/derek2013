Here's Zine #2, which is also full of random shit. There's less written here, a little more appropriated.

There's a damn lot of fine old public domain illustrations at [Openclipart](http://openclipart.org/). Take a nice woodcut of a bird and use a non-default serif font and you got yourself some instant class. Just look at this page.
Sounds like a brand new violin, that's what.
